This library contains a set of tools for tracking objects through GPS data real-time.  
It contains implementations of Bayesian particle filters for on-road and off-road 2D motion and state-parameter estimation.

See https://github.com/openplans/openplans-tracking-tools/wiki for a better description of this library.

To build the graph, you need OpenTripPlanner's graph builder and to run a command like:
 java -Xmx2048m -cp path/to/openplans-tracking-tools.jar:opentripplanner-graph-builder/target/graph-builder.jar org.opentripplanner.graph_builder.GraphBuilderMain osm_data_file.xml

Some useful JProfiler settings are:
